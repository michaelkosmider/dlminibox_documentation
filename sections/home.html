<h1>DLminibox Documentation</h1>
<p>Welcome to the documentation for <strong>DLminibox</strong>. This <a href="https://github.com/michaelkosmider/dlminibox" target="_blank">library</a> provides functions, modules and optimizers built on top of an automatic differentiation system allowing you to build powerful deep learning AI models. If you haven't already, please start by reading the <a href="https://michaelkosmider.github.io/dlminiboxtutorial/" target="_blank">tutorial</a> to understand the theoretical foundations of this system.</p>

<p>This documentation is unique in the sense each section contains a detailed theoretical explanation following the tutorial, in addition to usage information. I designed this library along with its documentation primarily for teaching purposes, although it is a highly capable system as well. I used it to train a CNN model, achieving 80%+ accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset (also available <a href="https://github.com/michaelkosmider/dlminibox/blob/main/cnn_example.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a>):</p>
