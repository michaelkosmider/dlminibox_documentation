<h1>DLminibox Documentation</h1>
<p>Welcome to the documentation for <strong>DLminibox</strong>. This library provides functions, modules and optimizers built on top of an automatic differentiation system allowing you to build powerful deep learning AI models. If you haven't already, please start by reading the <a href="https://michaelkosmider.github.io/dlminiboxtutorial/">tutorial</a> to understand the theoretical foundations of this system.</p>

<p>This documentation is unique in the sense each section contains a detailed theoretical explanation following the tutorial, in addition to usage information. I designed this library along with its documentation primarily for teaching purposes, although it is a highly capable system as well, using it to train a ResNet-50 model, achieving 90%+ accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset:</p>
