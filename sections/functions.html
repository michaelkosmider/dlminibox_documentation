<h1>Functions</h1>

Functions and variables are the two entities at the heart of autodiff. As described in the tutorial, each function takes in a list of tensors and outputs a tensor. A function both computes the output tensor and connects that output tensor to the input tensors in the computation graph. Finally, each function has a corresponding backward function that implicitly applies the chain rule to all scalars in the input during backpropagation.
